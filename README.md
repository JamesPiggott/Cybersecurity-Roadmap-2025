# Cybersecurity-Roadmap-2025

For some time now, I have considered obtaining a professional certificate in Cybersecurity. I have, for nearly a decade, been professionally interested in cybersecurity, thus far I have obtained certificates from the Coursera / RIT course on cybersecurity and I work as a hosting / DevOps engineer. I think it would harm my career from now on if I do not supplement my university degree with a professional certificate. The company I work for has now officially supported my effort, so for 2025 I intend to obtain two certificates: Network+ & Security+. Both are considered entry-level, but I think they are good milestones for other certificates at a later date.

Below I have created a rough roadmap of things I want to do to obtain the certificates, it includes courses, CTF challenges, in-depth study of tools & practices, books to read, soft skills to develop & programming projects. I am cheating a little bit because I have started with some of this already, but you can still study along as well.

In the past I have created a similar repository: [Acing the Software Interview,](https://github.com/JamesPiggott/Acing-the-Software-Engineering-Interview) it certainly helped set some suitable goals to continue developing my skills beyond what I learned at university. However, in light of this roadmap that repo has become mostly superfluous. I will tidy it up so others can use it if they want but this roadmap will be my main focus.

At the bottom of this roadmap, there are personal goals. Yours might differ, but I do intend to put my name out there: YouTube etc.
